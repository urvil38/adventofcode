# Advent Of Code

This repo contains solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/about) puzzles. 

The solutions I've added might not be the optimal or best way to solve a particular problem because my goal is to improve my [problem solving skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/) and not to care too much about code quality. There is no one way or the best way to solve these puzzles; however, I try my best to write readable and understandable code which is easy to reason and follow.
